# climada_advanced
additional features (mainly for core climada)

additional/doc for documentation.

In order to grant core climada access to additional modules, create a folder ‘modules’ in the core climada folder and copy/move the module climada_advanced into climada/modules, without 'climada_' in the filename.

climada sources all modules' code upon startup
